# Papá Noel Secreto!

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## What is this?

Yet another secret Santa, Papá Noel is the Argentinian name for Santa Claus

## Architecture

- Angular on the frontend

- Express on the backend

- nx.dev as a monorepo

- Heroku as the production environment

### Why this stack?

- FE: I feel quite comfortable with Angular

- BE: by chance I guess, it was straighforward to set up [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/)

- Nx: just trying it ;)
